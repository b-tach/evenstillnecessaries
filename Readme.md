# Even Still Necessaries

This mod mods the [mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/5906) that mods the [mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/19) for the game Vintage Story.

More specifically, modder ZigTheHedge initially created a really cool mod called [Necessaries](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/19). Last update for it was in September 2022 for Vintage Story version 1.17. Once VS 1.18 was released, the mod stopped working. Another modder, Stahl, took the [original code](https://github.com/ZigTheHedge/vsmods/tree/1.14/mods/necessaries) and [updated it](https://github.com/antoinehu/vs-stillnecessaries), continuing to update to keep it compatible. However, 1.20 is now out (as of writing this, it is in release candidate status) and it is no longer working! This is my effort at tinkering to make it work.

The other thing you might notice from the aforementioned code repositories is that there are no `.csproj` files or solutions to readily compile the source. I've included them in this to make it a little easier for anybody to take the code and do things with it!

At the time of writing this, there is no visible license for ZigTheHedge's code or Stahl's modifications. I am unsure of the legalities but as far as I'm concerned it is still ZigTheHedge's project. Whatever is permissible to him/her is also to me.
